## Get started in three steps

Use Samay to track where you spend time: download the desktop app, create an account, and connect.

### Step 1: Download the Samay desktop app

The desktop app (macOS) runs in the background and records which apps you use and for how long.

1. Download the latest release: [Samay.dmg](https://github.com/chenchunaidu-proximity/samay-core-engine/releases/download/v1.0.0/Samay.dmg)
2. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Samay** to Applications
3. Launch Samay from Applications

<Tip>
Activity is recorded locally. Nothing is sent to the cloud until you connect your account in Step 3.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Create an account

1. Go to [getsamay.vercel.app/sign-up](https://getsamay.vercel.app/sign-up)
2. Enter your name, email, and password
3. Confirm your email if required and sign in

Your account is used to sync activity to the web dashboard and to access Insights, Projects, and Tasks.

### Step 3: Connect to desktop

1. Sign in at [getsamay.vercel.app](https://getsamay.vercel.app)
2. In the **sidebar**, click **Connect to Desktop**
3. Your browser will open a `samay://` link that hands your token and API URL to the Samay app
4. The desktop app will link to your account and start syncing activity

After this, your activity will appear on the [Dashboard](https://getsamay.vercel.app/dashboard) and [Tasks](https://getsamay.vercel.app/tasks).
