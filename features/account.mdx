## Overview

The **Account** area lets you manage your **profile** and **workspaces**. You see your name, email, and avatar, and you can manage workspaces (create, edit, invite users, switch workspace). Open it at [getsamay.vercel.app/account](https://getsamay.vercel.app/account) (or via **Account** in the app navigation).

## Features in detail

### Profile section

- **Display:** Your **name**, **email**, and **avatar** (or initials if no image).  
- **Purpose:** Quick confirmation of who is signed in; base for future profile editing (e.g. change name, email, password, avatar).  
- **Data source:** From the current auth context (e.g. `user.name`, `user.email`); avatar may be a URL or default.

### Workspaces

- **Workspaces container:** Lists **workspaces** you belong to.  
- **Per workspace:** Name, optional description; actions such as **edit**, **invite user**, or **leave**.  
- **Workspace dropdown:** Elsewhere in the app (e.g. sidebar or header), a **workspace selector** lets you **switch** the current workspace.  
- **Edit workspace:** Change name, description, or other settings (for admins/owners).  
- **Invite user:** Add users to the workspace by email or selection (for admins/owners).  
- **Workspace detail:** Some UIs have a workspace detail page (e.g. `/account/workspace/[id]`) for members and settings.

### Workspace vs project

- **Workspace:** Often the top-level “organization” or “team” — you have one current workspace, and data (projects, activity) may be scoped to it.  
- **Project:** Sub-group under a workspace for organizing work; you can be in multiple projects.  
- **Account** focuses on **profile** and **workspaces**; **Projects** focuses on **projects** and their members.

### Data and permissions

- **Profile:** Read from auth; edits (if available) may call a profile or user API.  
- **Workspaces:** Listed and managed via workspace APIs; create/edit/invite/leave depend on your role (admin/owner vs member).

## Related

- **Settings** — app-level settings (e.g. theme, notifications) may live under Settings rather than Account.  
- **Projects** — projects are usually scoped to a workspace; manage them from the Projects page.  
- **Admin Dashboard** — admins can manage users and roles across the workspace.
