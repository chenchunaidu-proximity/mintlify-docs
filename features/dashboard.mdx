## Overview

The **Dashboard** is the main overview of your tracked activity. It shows how much time you spend on applications and activities over a chosen date range. Open it at [getsamay.vercel.app/dashboard](https://getsamay.vercel.app/dashboard).

## Features in detail

### Date range picker

- **Location:** Top of the Dashboard, next to the “Dashboard” title.  
- **Behavior:** Lets you choose a **from** and **to** date (single day or range).  
- **Effect:** All sections (Top apps, Top activities, Top tags) use this range.  
- **Use case:** Compare today vs yesterday, or view a full week or month.

### Top apps

- **Total duration:** Sum of all tracked time in the selected range (e.g. “4h 32m”).  
- **Top 5 apps:** The five applications you used most, with time per app.  
- **Display:** Usually app name (and optionally icon), duration, and sometimes percentage of total.  
- **Use case:** See which apps consume the most time (browser, IDE, Slack, etc.).

### Top tags

- **Content:** Most-used **tags** in the selected range (if your activity is tagged).  
- **Display:** Tag name and often duration or count.  
- **Use case:** See time by category or project when you use Projects and tags.

### Top activities

- **Content:** A **list of activities** in the range.  
- **Per activity:** Typically app (and sometimes window title), duration, time window, optional tags.  
- **Display:** Cards or rows, often sortable or filterable.  
- **Use case:** Detailed, chronological view of what you did and for how long.

## Data source

Dashboard data comes from activity **synced by the Samay desktop app** after you **Connect to Desktop**. If you see no data:

1. Ensure the desktop app is installed and running.  
2. Ensure you clicked **Connect to Desktop** and approved the `samay://` link.  
3. Use your Mac for a bit and refresh; check that the date range includes the day you were active.
