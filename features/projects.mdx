## Overview

**Projects** let you group work and optionally add **members**. You can create projects, open them to see details and a **user list**, and (as an admin) add or remove users, update, or delete projects. Open the list at [getsamay.vercel.app/projects](https://getsamay.vercel.app/projects).

## Features in detail

### Projects list

- **Content:** All projects you have access to.  
- **Per project:** Name, description, icon (if set).  
- **Action:** Click a project to open the **project detail** page (`/projects/[id]`).  
- **Add project:** Button (e.g. “Add project”) to create a new project — visible to users with permission (e.g. admins).

### Create project (Add project)

- **Form fields:** Typically **name**, **description**, and optionally **icon** (or avatar/image).  
- **Validation:** Name required; description and icon optional.  
- **Submit:** Creates the project and adds it to the list; you may be redirected to the new project or stay on the list.  
- **Permission:** Only users who can create projects (e.g. admins) see the button and form.

### Project detail page

- **URL:** `/projects/[id]` (e.g. [getsamay.vercel.app/projects/123](https://getsamay.vercel.app/projects)).  
- **Header:** Project **name**, **description**, and **icon** (e.g. avatar or image).  
- **User list:** All **members** of the project.  
- **Admin actions (if you’re an admin):**  
  - **Update project** — change name, description, icon  
  - **Delete project** — remove the project  
  - **Add users** — invite or add existing users to the project  
  - **Remove users** — remove members from the project  
- **Non-admin:** Usually can only view project info and user list.

### Add users to a project

- **Entry point:** On the project detail page, an “Add user” (or “Invite” / “Add member”) action.  
- **Flow:** Enter email or select a user from your workspace/organization; submit to add them to the project.  
- **Permission:** Only admins (or project admins) can add users.

### Remove users from a project

- **Entry point:** In the project’s user list, a remove/leave action per user (e.g. trash icon or “Remove from project”).  
- **Permission:** Only admins (or project admins) can remove users.

### Projects and Dashboard/Tasks

- Projects (and **tags**) can be used to categorize activity.  
- On the **Dashboard**, **Top tags** may reflect project or category tags.  
- In **Tasks**, activity cards may show project or tag info if the backend and UI support it.

## Permissions

- **Admin users** (site or workspace admins) can create, edit, delete projects and add/remove members.  
- **Project members** can view the project and its user list; some setups allow “project admins” to manage members.  
- The **Admin Dashboard** (for admins only) lists all users and supports user/role management.
