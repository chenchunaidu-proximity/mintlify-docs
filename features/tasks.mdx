## Overview

**Tasks** lets you browse and manage your tracked activities by **day** or **month**. It’s the detailed view of “what you did” — individual activities with app, duration, and time. Open it at [getsamay.vercel.app/tasks](https://getsamay.vercel.app/tasks).

## Features in detail

### Day and month tabs

- **Day:** Activities for a **single selected date**. You pick the date with a date picker; the list shows all activities for that day.  
- **Month:** Activities for a **month** (or month range). You select a month; the list shows activities in that period.  
- **Use case:** Day view for “what did I do today/yesterday”; month view for weekly or monthly review.

### Day view

- **Date picker:** Choose the day (e.g. today, yesterday, or any past date).  
- **Activities list:** Each item typically includes:  
  - **App** (and sometimes window title or description)  
  - **Duration**  
  - **Time window** (start/end or timestamp)  
  - Optional **tags** or project  
- **Empty state:** If there’s no activity for that day, a message or empty list is shown.  
- **Loading/error:** Loading spinner while fetching; error message if the request fails.

### Month view

- **Month selector:** Choose the month (and possibly year).  
- **Activities list:** Same structure as day view but for the whole month (or month range).  
- **Use case:** Billing, reporting, or “how much did I work in March?”.

### Data source

Tasks data comes from the same backend as the **Dashboard** — activity synced by the **Samay desktop app** after you **Connect to Desktop**. The backend returns activities filtered by the selected date or month.
