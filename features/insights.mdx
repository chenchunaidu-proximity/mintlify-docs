## Overview

**Insights** gives you a **daily summary** of your activity and **AI-generated suggestions** (“AIs to Improve your day”) to help you use time better. It’s available at [getsamay.vercel.app/insights](https://getsamay.vercel.app/insights).

Insights are generated using **yesterday’s top 100 tasks** (or a similar recent activity set), so you see a reflection on your recent usage and actionable tips.

## Features in detail

### Summary section

- **Content:** A short **summary** of your recent activity (e.g. narrative “what you did” or “where time went”).  
- **Data source:** Based on recent activity (e.g. yesterday’s top 100 tasks).  
- **Purpose:** Quick read without opening the full task list; good for a daily check-in.  
- **Display:** Usually a block of text or a list of summary points.

### AIs to Improve your day

- **Content:** **Improvement plan** or list of **suggestions** (e.g. “spend less time in X”, “block time for Y”, “limit Z”).  
- **Data source:** Generated from your activity (e.g. app usage, duration, patterns).  
- **Purpose:** Actionable tips to improve focus and productivity.  
- **Display:** List or cards under a header like “AIs to Improve your day”.

### Header and description

- **Title:** “Insights”.  
- **Subtitle:** Explains that you’re viewing daily activity insights and summaries, with a note such as “*Generated using yesterday’s top 100 tasks”.  
- **Loading:** Spinner or skeleton while data is loading.  
- **Error:** If the request fails, an error card or message is shown (e.g. “Failed to load insights. Please try again later.”).

### Data flow

1. The frontend calls the **insights API** (e.g. `useInsights()`).  
2. The backend uses your **recent activity** (e.g. yesterday’s top 100 tasks) to generate:  
   - **dailyInsights** — summary text or list  
   - **improvementPlan** — suggestions or improvement plan  
3. The UI renders **Summary** from `dailyInsights` and **AIs to Improve your day** from `improvementPlan`.

## When Insights are empty

- **No recent activity:** Ensure the desktop app is connected and has synced; check the Dashboard for the same period.  
- **First day:** There may be no “yesterday” data yet.  
- **Backend/AI limits:** Generation may depend on backend or AI availability; retry later if you see an error.
