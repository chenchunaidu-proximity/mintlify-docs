## Overview

The **Dashboard** shows how much time you spend on different **apps** and **activities** over a chosen date range. Use it to see your top apps, total duration, tags, and a list of activities.

## What you see on the Dashboard

### Date range

At the top, a **date picker** lets you choose:

- A **single day** — set “from” and “to” to the same date  
- A **range** — e.g. last 7 days or a custom week/month  

All sections (Top apps, Top activities, Top tags) use this range.

### Top apps

- **Total duration** — sum of tracked time in the selected range.  
- **Top 5 apps** — the five applications you used most, with time per app.  
- Each row usually shows **app name** (and optionally icon) and **time spent**.

Use this to see which apps consume the most time (e.g. browser, IDE, Slack).

### Top tags

If your activity is tagged (e.g. by project or category), **Top tags** shows the most used tags in the range. Helps you see time by category or project at a glance.

### Top activities

A **list of activities** in the range. Each activity typically has:

- **App** (and sometimes window title or description)  
- **Duration**  
- **Time window** (e.g. start/end or date)  
- Optional **tags**

Use this for a detailed, chronological view of what you did.

## How to use it

1. **Pick a date range** — e.g. today, yesterday, or last 7 days.  
2. **Check total duration** — see how much time was tracked overall.  
3. **Review top apps** — identify the apps you use most.  
4. **Scan top tags** — see how time is distributed by tag/project.  
5. **Scroll Top activities** — inspect specific blocks of time and apps.

## Tips

- **Empty state:** If you see no data, ensure the **desktop app** is installed, **connected** (Connect to Desktop), and that you’ve used the machine in the selected range.  
- **Range:** Larger ranges (e.g. a week) smooth out daily noise; single days are good for “what did I do today?”.  
- **Tags:** If you use **Projects** and tag activity, Top tags on the Dashboard will reflect that.
