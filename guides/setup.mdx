## Overview

To use Samay you need:

1. **Samay desktop app** (macOS) — records which apps you use and for how long  
2. **Samay account** — sign up at [getsamay.vercel.app](https://getsamay.vercel.app)  
3. **Connection** — link the desktop app to your account so activity syncs to the web

<Info>
The web app at [getsamay.vercel.app](https://getsamay.vercel.app) is where you view Dashboard, Tasks, Insights, and Projects. The desktop app only collects and sends activity; it does not show reports.

## Step 1: Download and install the desktop app

1. Go to the [Samay releases](https://github.com/chenchunaidu-proximity/samay-core-engine/releases) page (or use the direct link: [Samay.dmg v1.0.0](https://github.com/chenchunaidu-proximity/samay-core-engine/releases/download/v1.0.0/Samay.dmg)).
2. Download **Samay.dmg**.
3. Open the DMG and drag **Samay** into **Applications**.
4. Open **Samay** from Applications (you may need to allow it in **System Preferences → Privacy & Security**).

The app will start tracking app usage locally. No data is sent until you connect your account.

## Step 2: Create an account

1. Open [getsamay.vercel.app/sign-up](https://getsamay.vercel.app/sign-up).
2. Enter:
   - **Name** — display name
   - **Email** — used to sign in
   - **Password** — secure password
3. Submit the form and complete any email verification if required.
4. Sign in at [getsamay.vercel.app/login](https://getsamay.vercel.app/login).

## Step 3: Connect to desktop

1. While signed in at [getsamay.vercel.app](https://getsamay.vercel.app), open the **sidebar** (hamburger or sidebar icon if collapsed).
2. Click **Connect to Desktop**.
3. Your browser will try to open a link like `samay://token?token=...&url=...`. When prompted, choose **Open** so the Samay app receives the token and API URL.
4. The Samay desktop app will store the token and start syncing activity to your account.

<Tip>
If "Connect to Desktop" does nothing, ensure the Samay desktop app is installed and that your browser is allowed to open `samay://` links. On macOS, the app must be run at least once before the custom URL scheme works.
</Tip>

## Verify setup

1. Use your Mac normally for a few minutes (open a few apps).
2. In the Samay web app, go to [Dashboard](https://getsamay.vercel.app/dashboard).
3. Pick **today** in the date picker. You should see **Top apps** and **Top activities** (and possibly **Top tags**) once data has synced.

If nothing appears, check that:

- The desktop app is running.
- You clicked **Connect to Desktop** and approved opening the `samay://` link.
- Your network can reach the Samay backend (no firewall blocking it).
