## What are projects?

**Projects** in Samay let you group work and optionally add **members**. You can:

- Create projects with a name, description, and icon  
- Add users to a project (for admins)  
- Open a project to see its details and **user list**  
- Use projects (and tags) to see time by category on the Dashboard and elsewhere  

Projects are useful for separating “Work”, “Personal”, “Client A”, etc., and for team visibility when you add members.

## Create a project

1. Go to [Projects](https://getsamay.vercel.app/projects).  
2. Click **Add project** (or the main “new project” button).  
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** — e.g. “Frontend”, “Client X”  
   - **Description** — optional  
   - **Icon** — optional; some UIs let you pick an image or avatar  
4. Submit. The new project appears in the project list.

Only users with permission (e.g. admins or project admins) can create projects; if you don’t see the button, your role may not allow it.

## View project list

On the **Projects** page you see:

- All projects you have access to  
- For each: name, description, icon (if set)  
- Clicking a project opens the **project detail** page (e.g. `/projects/[id]`)

## Project detail page

Opening a project shows:

- **Header** — project name, description, icon  
- **User list** — members of the project  

If you are an **admin** (or project admin), you can:

- **Add users** — invite or add existing users to the project  
- **Remove users** — remove members from the project  
- **Update project** — change name, description, or icon  
- **Delete project** — remove the project (use with care)

Non-admin members typically only see the project info and user list.

## Add users to a project

1. Open the project (click it from the Projects list).  
2. Use **Add user** (or “Invite” / “Add member”).  
3. Enter email or select a user from your workspace/organization.  
4. Confirm. The user is added and can see the project (and may get notifications depending on your setup).

## Remove users

1. Open the project.  
2. Find the user in the **user list**.  
3. Use the remove/leave action (e.g. trash icon or “Remove from project”).  
4. Confirm. The user loses access to that project.

## Permissions

- **Admin users** (site or workspace admins) can create, edit, delete projects and add/remove members.  
- **Project members** can usually view the project and its user list; some setups allow “project admins” to manage members.  
- The **Admin Dashboard** (for admins only) lists all users; from there you can manage access and roles.

If you don’t see “Add project” or “Add user”, you’re likely not an admin. Ask an admin to create the project or add you.
