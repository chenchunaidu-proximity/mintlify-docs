## What are Insights?

**Insights** at [getsamay.vercel.app/insights](https://getsamay.vercel.app/insights) give you:

- **Summary** — a short overview of your recent activity (e.g. “yesterday’s” summary)  
- **AIs to Improve your day** — suggestions or an improvement plan based on your usage  

Insights are generated from your tracked activity (e.g. using **yesterday’s top 100 tasks**). They help you reflect on where time went and what to change.

## Where to find Insights

1. Sign in at [getsamay.vercel.app](https://getsamay.vercel.app).  
2. In the **sidebar**, click **Insights**.  
3. The Insights page shows **Summary** and **AIs to Improve your day** (or similar sections).

## Summary section

- **Content:** A textual summary of your activity, often based on **yesterday’s top 100 tasks**.  
- **Purpose:** Quick read on “what I did” or “where my time went” without opening the full task list.  
- **Frequency:** Usually one summary per day (e.g. for the previous day).  

If the summary is empty, you may not have had enough activity in the time window used for generation, or the backend may still be processing.

## AIs to Improve your day

- **Content:** A list or paragraph of **suggestions** or an **improvement plan** (e.g. “spend less time in X”, “block time for Y”).  
- **Purpose:** Actionable tips to improve focus and productivity based on your actual usage.  
- **Source:** Generated from your activity (e.g. app usage, duration, patterns).  

Use this section to pick one or two changes to try (e.g. limiting a specific app or scheduling deep work).

## How Insights are generated

- The app sends your **recent activity** (e.g. yesterday’s top 100 tasks) to the backend.  
- The backend (or an integrated AI service) produces:  
  - **Summary** — narrative summary of that activity  
  - **Improvement plan** — suggestions tailored to your usage  
- The exact algorithm and data window may vary; the UI often states “Generated using yesterday’s top 100 tasks”.

## When Insights are empty or missing

- **No recent activity:** Ensure the **desktop app** is connected and has been recording; check the **Dashboard** for the same period.  
- **First day:** There may be no “yesterday” data yet; wait until the next day or check again later.  
- **Errors:** If the page shows an error, try refreshing or reconnecting the desktop app; if it persists, there may be a temporary backend issue.

## Tips for using Insights

1. **Check daily** — make it a short routine (e.g. morning) to read the summary and one improvement.  
2. **Act on one suggestion** — pick one “AI to improve your day” and try it for a few days.  
3. **Compare with Dashboard** — use the Dashboard (top apps, total time) to validate what Insights are based on.  
4. **Use with Projects/tags** — if you use Projects and tags, Insights may (depending on implementation) take them into account for better context.
